	abstract = {In the era of data revolution, availability and presence of data is a huge wealth that has to be utilized. Instead of making new surveys, benefit can be made from data that already exists. As enormous amounts of data become available, it is becoming essential to undertake research that involves integrating data from multiple sources in order to make the best use out of it. Statistical Data Integration (SDI) is the statistical tool for considering this issue. SDI can be used to integrate data files that have common units, and it also allows to merge unrelated files that do not share any common units, depending on the input data. The convenient method of data integration is determined according to the nature of the input data. SDI has two main methods, Record Linkage (RL) and Statistical Matching (SM). SM techniques typically aim to achieve a complete data file from different sources which do not contain the same units. This paper aims at giving a complete overview of existing SM methods, both classical and recent, in order to provide a unified summary of various SM techniques along with their drawbacks. Points for future research are suggested at the end of this paper.},

The CPS is a monthly U.S. household survey conducted jointly by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. IPUMS-CPS contains harmonized data from every Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) supplement from 1962 to the present and all other supplements from 1976 to present. In addition to the many of the variables included in census data (race and ethnicity, education, income, occupation, industry, migration, disability, and veteran status), IPUMS-CPS includes additional information on work and income, such as participation in welfare programs, job searching, barriers to looking for work, union membership, hourly wages, health insurance, and tax liability. In addition, monthly supplements supplemental for certain years include information on computer and Internet use, displaced workers, fertility, food security, job tenure, tobacco use, volunteer activities, voter registration, and work schedules. IPUMS-CPS data are available through an online data access system free of charge to registered users at cps.ipums.org.},
